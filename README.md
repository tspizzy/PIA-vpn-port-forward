# PIA-vpn-port-forward
Users of Private Internet Access VPN are required to requests a new port forward port each time they login.

Run this script and a pop-up will appear stating which port they should be using for the current session. Configure your torrent client as necessary.

This has only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04. May work on other versions of Ubuntu, but almost certainly not Windows.
